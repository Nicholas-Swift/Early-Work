Assuming that 'scores' is a vector that holds elements of type int,
what's wrong with the following code snippet (meant to increment
each element)?

vector<int>::iterator iter;
//increment each score
for (iter = scores.begin(); iter != scores.end(); ++iter);
{
	iter++;
}

The following code doesn't work because the 'iter++' is incrementing the iter
which is part of the for loop.

To get it to work, you need to increment the value that the iterator is pointing to,
not the actual iterator. The code below is what SHOULD be used.

vector<int>::iterator iter;
//increment each score
for (iter = scores.begin(); iter != scores.end(); ++iter);
{
	*iter += 1;
}
