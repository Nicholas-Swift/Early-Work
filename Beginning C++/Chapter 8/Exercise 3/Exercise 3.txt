What design problem does the following program have?

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Critter
{
public:
	int GetHunger() const {return m_Hunger;}
private:
	int m_Hunger;
};

int main()
{
	Critter crit;
	cout<<crit.GetHunger()<<endl;
	return 0;
}

m_Hunger has no value set to it and there is no Critter() declaration in the class.
