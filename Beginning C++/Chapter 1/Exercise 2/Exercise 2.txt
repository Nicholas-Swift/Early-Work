What's displayed by each line in the following code snippet? Explain each result.

cout<<"Seven divided by three is "<<7/3<<endl;
cout<<"Seven divided by three is "<<7.0/3<<endl;
cout<<"Seven divided by three is "<<7.0/3.0<<endl;

7/3 will be considered an integer, so it will display only an integer answer.
7.0/3 and 7.0/3.0 will be considered a float, because of the decimal.
