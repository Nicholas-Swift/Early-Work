Create a list of six legal variable names - three good and three bad choices. Explain
why each name falls into the good or bad category.

Good: int noobsKilled, string name, const int DAMAGE
Bad:  int NoobsKilled, string NaMe, const int damage

while they are all legal, the good variable names are more easily read as well as
a standard for programming.
