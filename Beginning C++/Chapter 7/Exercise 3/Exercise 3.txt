Will the three memory addresses displayed by the following program all be the same?
Explain what's going on in the code.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int a = 10;
	int& b = a;
	int* c = &b;

	cout<<&a<<endl;
	cout<<&b<<endl;
	cout<<&(*c)<<endl;

	return 0
}

All three memory adresses displayed will be the same, because the reference is to int a's
memory adress, and the pointer is to int a's memory adress. They all point to the same
memory adress.
